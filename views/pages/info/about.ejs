        <!-- Our Story -->
        <div class="bg-slate-900 rounded-3xl p-12 border border-slate-800 flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-12 items-center mb-24">
            <div class="flex-1">
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Our Story</h2>
                <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
                    <p>It started in a small dorm room, late at night, with conversations every creator has at least once: “What if this actually works?” “What if this idea could become something real?”</p>
                    <p>The world had platforms for finished work — GitHub for code, Dribbble for design, LinkedIn for careers — but no true home for raw ideas.</p>
                    <p>Most ideas never see daylight. They remain trapped in notebooks, chats, or half-written documents. Not because they are bad, but because creators lack feedback, validation, and belief.</p>
                    <p>Ideate was born to become that missing launchpad — a place where curiosity is valued over perfection and imagination is encouraged to breathe.</p>
                    <p>Today, Ideate is a growing ecosystem of students, founders, engineers, artists, and dreamers turning early thoughts into startups, projects, and movements.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-3">Ideas are living things. They grow when shared, evolve when challenged, and die when hidden.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-3">We believe progress is born from dialogue, not silence. From collaboration, not competition.</p>
            <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">Every revolution begins as a fragile thought. Our mission is to protect and nurture those thoughts.</p>

                We are building more than a platform. We are building the world's largest open innovation network.
